 *   2. **Raw payload at-rest** — the confirm card needs un-redacted args to
 *      let the user make an informed decision (Phase 2.5 binary-channel
 *      invariant: confirm shows raw, panel-step display redacts). The raw
 *      lives in storage for the duration of the pending confirm so that
 *      panel re-mount can re-render the card; on resolve (approve/reject)
 *      the SW immediately scrubs this field.
 *
 * `kind` is the discriminator for the M1-U4 `SessionConfirmRequestMessage`

// ── M3-U4 — Tool class registry ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every built-in tool declares whether it is a `read` or `write` operation
// against page / tab / browser state. The R7 lock (loop.ts dispatch) uses
// the class to gate cross-session conflicts: a `write` tool whose target
// tab is pinned by another active session is refused with an observation.
// `read` tools (list_tabs, scroll, etc.) are allowed
// concurrently because the user has informed-approved the data exposure
// at confirm time and read concurrency does not corrupt page state.
//
// Classification rationale:
//   - click / type / select / dispatch_keyboard_input / press_key — write
//       (mutates form state, focus, IME buffer, page nav).
//   - scroll / wait / done / fail — read or no-op against tab state.
//   - create_skill / update_skill / delete_skill — write (mutates persistent
//       extension storage; not a tab interaction but still write-class so
//       a future cross-session quota lock could reuse the same dispatch
//       point if needed).
//   - list_skills — read.
//   - list_tabs / activate_tab — read (informational
//       reads + activate-tab which only changes which tab is foregrounded,
//       not its content).
//   - close_tabs / group_tabs / ungroup_tabs / move_tabs — write (mutates
//       tab existence / containment / order).
//   - use_skill / read_skill_file — read (pure text producers; invoke a
//       skill or read a skill file; no tab/page side effects).
//
// Build-time check below ensures every name in KNOWN_BUILT_IN_TOOL_NAMES
// or KNOWN_KEYBOARD_TOOL_NAMES has a matching entry. A new tool that
// doesn't declare a class throws at module load.

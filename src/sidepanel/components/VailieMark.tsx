/**
 * VailieMark — the brand IP: a borderless gradient blob that IS the assistant.
 *
 * Static frame is always a CLEAN CIRCLE with edges dissolving to transparent
 * (no outline, no shadow, no clip edge — the shape is defined purely by colour
 * fading to alpha 0). Motion is the only thing that lets the shape deform;
 * every animation returns to the circle. Silver-grey body, sky-blue welling up
 * from below, a peach filament in the upper-right — the 60/30/10 mix.
 *
 * States (mesh + motion):
 *   idle      — balanced; 8s breathe, barely perceptible
 *   thinking  — peach filament stirs; 2.4s quicker pulse ("it's thinking")
 *   working   — denser, blue-forward; directional churn ("acting on the page")
 *   done      — peach bloom then settle back to idle
 *   recording — peach-forward variant used as the recording indicator
 *
 * Pure CSS gradients, no deps. Honours prefers-reduced-motion (motion off).
 * Keyframes live in vailie-mark.css (import once, e.g. in index.css).

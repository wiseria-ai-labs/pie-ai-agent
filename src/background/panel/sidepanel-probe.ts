// Can this browser actually show an extension side panel?
//
// Arc ships the `chrome.sidePanel` API surface and does not service it. The
// failure mode is worse than an error: measured on a real install, `open()`
// RESOLVES SUCCESSFULLY and no panel is ever shown. Vivaldi is a softer version
// of the same story (the API works but ignores `tabId`).
//
// That rules out all three of the obvious detection strategies:
//
//   - presence — the namespace and every method are there;
//   - rejection — nothing rejects, so `.catch()` guards never fire;
//   - timeout  — nothing hangs either, so a race also reports success.
//
// The API's own report is simply not evidence. So `tryOpenSidePanel` measures
// the OUTCOME: after `open()` resolves it asks `chrome.runtime.getContexts`
// whether a SIDE_PANEL document is running, falling back to a liveness ping the
// panel answers on browsers without that API. The timeout race is kept too,
// since a browser that hangs still can't open a panel.
//
// Even that was not enough. On Arc both outcome checks come back positive and
// the user still sees nothing — a document is created and never shown, which no
// service-worker-side signal can distinguish from a working panel. So this
// module is a DEFAULT, not an authority: `lib/panel-host/panel-mode.ts` holds a
// persisted user preference that overrides everything here.

// Deciding WHERE Pie's panel opens, and wiring the entry points that ask.
//
// The mechanics live next door:
//   - `panel/sidepanel-probe.ts`  — can this browser show a side panel?
//   - `panel/fallback-window.ts`  — opening the panel outside the side panel
//   - `panel/context-menu.ts`     — the right-click entry point
//
// This module holds only the decision and the order it is made in, because that
// order is the substance of the Arc fix. Detection cannot be trusted: measured
// on Arc, `sidePanel.open()` resolves, the `openPanelOnActionClick` pref is
// stored, and both outcome checks report a live panel — while the user sees
// nothing. So the persisted user preference is consulted FIRST and outranks
// every probe; detection is what happens when the user hasn't said otherwise.

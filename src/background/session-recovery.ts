/**
 * M1-U5 — SW cold-start recovery: detect in-flight tasks that died
 * with the Service Worker and transition them to a state the user can
 * act on (`paused` for tasks that reached at least one step boundary;
 * `failed` for tasks that died mid-confirm — the resolver is gone, we
 * can't honor the pending approval).
 *
 * Trigger paths (advisor: don't rely on `onStartup` alone — MV3 SW
 * dies silently after 30s idle and `onStartup` does NOT fire on the
 * subsequent wake-up):
 *   1. SW top-level (every wake-up re-imports the file)        — main
 *   2. `chrome.runtime.onStartup` (Chrome process start)       — belt
 *   3. `chrome.runtime.onInstalled`                            — belt
 *   4. `panel-mounted` message handler                         — belt
 *
 * `recoveryGuard` (independent storage key — NOT in SessionMeta)
 * deduplicates calls within a 30s window so concurrent triggers
 * don't double-mark.
 *
 * Step ordering (P0 invariant — see plan SEC-PLAN-002):
 *   Step 1: scan all sessions, mark failed + scrub pendingConfirm for
 *           any session whose agent state has a pendingConfirm record.
 *           markFailed *before* scrub so a panel never observes
 *           "status=active + pendingConfirm cleared" mid-state.
 *   Step 2: re-list, mark paused for any remaining `active` session
 *           whose `stepIndex > 0` (in-flight when SW died).
 *   Step 3: bump the guard timestamp.
 *
 * Step 1 + 2 must be sequential (Step 2 reads the result of Step 1).

/**
 * Bug-fix-E — panel-disconnect recovery (per-port subset of detectAndMarkPaused).
 *
 * Walks the supplied session ids (= the inFlightSessionIds set kept inside
 * the onConnect closure for one sidepanel port) and applies the same
 * step-1 + step-2 transitions detectAndMarkPaused does on cold-start, but
 * scoped to ONLY this port's sessions. Multi-sidepanel safety: a sibling
 * port running its own tasks must not be touched when this port closes.
 *
 * Step ordering matches detectAndMarkPaused (SEC-PLAN-002):
 *   0. no agent record but sid in this port's in-flight set (Issue #21) →
 *      markFailed (task started, interrupted before any snapshot; unresumable).
 *   1. pendingConfirm present → markFailedAndScrub (resolver gone with
 *      the closing port; the request is unhonorable post-disconnect).
 *   2. else stepIndex > 0 → markPaused (in-flight, user-resumable via R10).
 *   3. else taskActive (Issue #21) → markFailed (interrupted at first step,
 *      zero history, unresumable — e.g. a first-step HITL card).
 *   4. else (tombstone, stepIndex===0 && !taskActive) → no-op (finished cleanly).
 *
 * No 30s guard: this is a user-driven event, not an idempotent SW wake-up
 * trigger; multiple panel close+reopen cycles must always re-mark.
 *
 * Errors are caught + logged per-session so a single bad agent record
 * does not abort the cleanup of remaining sessions.
